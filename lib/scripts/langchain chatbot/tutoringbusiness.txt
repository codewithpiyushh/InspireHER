Online tutoring and courses are the new norms in education. This post will tell you how to become a private tutor. The useful tips explained in this post will help you become a successful tutor from home and whether to pursue the profession parttime or fulltime. In India, the online tuition business is growing at a rapid pace. The emergence of platforms like Unacademy, online offerings by Time, Career Launcher, etc. shows how lucrative and profitable the online education segment is. Private tutors who have established their private tutor business and reputation can easily charge anything between Rs 1,000 and Rs 5,000 per hour, some even going higher than this. Then, there are complete courses on offer which can start from Rs 5,000 to even a lakh rupees! 1. Subject Knowledge 2. Tutoring Business Plan 3. Marketing And Competition 4. Insurance 5. Teaching Environment 6. Mode Of Payment 7. Cancellation Policy FAQ To start an online tuition business, you need to choose a subject in which you have deep knowledge. A subject where you dont rely on rotelearning but know the concepts insideout. Its not necessary to have a graduation degree and depends on the country you live in. Educational qualification is highly valued in India. So if you plan to teach Physics to Indian students but dont have a degree in the subject, students wont enrol in your course. Having a degree from a prominent institute strengthens your reputation as a tutor. Attracting students also becomes easy then. Its not difficult to find subject experts who cant teach the concepts and theory to students in simple language. You may have all the theoretical knowledge in the world but if you dont know how to convey it, tutoring is not meant for you. Next check the demand for lessons in your subject. For example, if you are teaching Maths, English, piano, or guitar, it helps to know how trending the subject is in terms of online tutoring. Teaching something specialized is a major factor that allows you to charge lucrative fees. Also, there is a need for regular lessons on the subject. Having a oneoff lesson with a student and ending it there wont make up for a good tutoring course. Regular delivery of content is essential to becoming a private tutor. You want to teach one subject or several, thats up to you. Its suggested to start out with one subject and then branch out further gradually. A business plan is needed for every business and the same goes with tutoring as well. Having a tutoring business plan is important and is overlooked by too many tutors. When they finally realize the importance of having a business plan, its too late. Why a business plan? Partly because it gives you a set of concrete goals to work towards. What do you want to achieve in six months? In a year? What are your target students and what do they require from a tutor? A business plan ensures you have an answer to these questions. People also want lessons for different reasons. A parent might want their son to learn Maths to get into university while someone else may want to learn the subject for acing an Olympiad. You need to think about your market carefully. Think about how much youre going to earn in one or two years. Write down the topics to give yourself tangible goals. The business plan also provides motivation because the first year of setting up the tutoring business can be tricky and draining. Identify how other tutoring businesses and individual tutors are marketing themselves. Do you see flyers in shops or in your locality? What about business cards, online advertising, Google AdWords, Facebook ads? You need to analyze both online and offline mediums to identify marketing techniques. You can then find other ways to market your business that are unique. Promotion is the hardest part of the online tutoring business. Unless people dont know you exist, theres no chance to build a tutoring career with a bright future. Advertising is highly effective if you know how to do it. One point often overlooked by people wanting to become a private tutor is insurance, specifically public liability insurance. Private tutor insurance is mandatory in this business. You need to protect yourself in unforeseen circumstances theres that one troublesome student who can disrupt your tuition business. If a student gets injured while he or she is at your home? What if the student trips over something and comes down crashing on your glass table? Though its a rare occurrence you cant disregard it. Liability insurance for tutoring businesses is important to protect yourself just in case there are accidents or negative incidents with students at your home. You need to have a neat and tidy workplace conducive to effective learning. There should not be too many distractions. It is important to dress appropriately and give the impression that you are a serious tutor. In case you live in shared accommodation, tell the other housemates or occupants living with you to not disturb while you teach. Setting up a disciplined teaching environment is important for your tutoring business to be successful. You should first offer a trial or a free first lesson to start. But in that trial lesson, make the payment mechanism clear. Otherwise, if you try and be too nice and relaxed about payment, people wont hesitate to take advantage of you and create difficulties and cancellations. You are selfemployed, so be serious and lay out your payment guidelines. You can offer discounts which will encourage people to enrol in your lessons. Defining the modes of payment accepted and the payment policies are important to establish a solid tutoring business. You need to have a detailed cancellation policy to avoid problems and awkward situations. Inform this policy to students before you start teaching them. It also protects your income. Say, if someone cancels the lessons 24 hours in advance and if they have paid for a block of lessons, your policy can include the clause,  You dont need to pay for next weeks lessons. This post is about how to start online tutoring in India and it also details the basic considerations and points you need to follow to set up your tutoring business.

Being selfemployed is a proud thing, so do not hesitate to demand your part of the money. Sometimes, payments and enrollments need to be cancelled, which can be challenging. That is why tutoring businesses need to have strict cancellation policies. Ensure every client knows the cancellation and refund policies to avoid any lastminute denials. Tutoring businesses can also include policies where students can withdraw any time up to 12 hours before the lesson starts for free, but if any class is cancelled within 12 hours of the opening time, students can be charged 50 of the tutor rates. When a client cancels within 12 hours of the lesson start time through their account, keep a feature where youll be informed and have the liability to either waive or charge the cancellation fee as per the set norms. To summarize, its advisable to have a precise cancellation policy and keep every new client aware of the guidelines right from the first day.

Home Tutoring services have been a big part of the education landscape for decades. You need a strategy and a plan to get the word out about your home tutoring business. Starting and running a home tuition business is not a big deal  it takes time, dedication, and a positive attitude. A wellsetup home tuition business will help you earn handsomely, as well as help you develop your side hobbies as well. Read about  Is home tutoring a good career option in India? In this blog, I have mentioned everything that you should keep in mind to start a home tuition business in India. Specialize in a subject If you have a passion for teaching, then home tutoring is something you should consider. The key to success in this business is to find a subject or subject areas that you like and can be passionate about. Specializing in a subject doesnt mean that you have studied or attained certification in that subject. It means that you know the subject knowledge in and out. For example, if youre a math tutor, you should be good at math and can explain complex concepts to your students. If youre a biology tutor, then you should know about the human body and how it works. Students who want to learn more about a subject should be able to get answers to their questions from their tutor, who is an expert on the topic. Create a schedule for your home tuition Home tutors should create a schedule of their tuition. This is because it helps the students and parents to understand what the tuition will be in advance. It also helps them to plan ahead and prepare for the upcoming classes. Home tutors should also provide a detailed description of their services so that students can choose whether they want to work with them or not. Students should not feel shy about asking questions or clarifying things before signing up for the service. Home tutors should take care of all the details at an early stage so that there are no unpleasant surprises at the end of this process. Create an online presence of your home tuition services. When you are looking for a home tuition service, the first thing that you need to do is create an online presence for your business. This can be done by creating an official website and blog that highlights the services that you provide. Online presence is important because it allows people to find out more about what kind of services you offer and how they can book the same. It also helps in building customer loyalty and brand recognition among people who are looking forward to hiring you as a home tutor. Learn 5 painless ways to find students for home tuition. Set your Fees You should set fees before you start working as a tutor. You can use this information to determine how much you will charge per hour and how many hours you will work each week. The first step is to know what your time is worth. This requires some research, so its important that you have a clear idea of what your time is worth before setting your rates. You should ask yourself questions like these How much do I get paid for teaching? What are my expenses like? How much time do I spend on my work each day? What is my overhead like accommodation, travel, etc.? Its important to set your fees before you begin. You dont want to be in a position where youre suddenly raising your fees because youve been doing the job for a while and have built up a reputation for being able to charge more. You should also consider advertising your tutoring services on local newspapers or websites like The tuition Teacher.com. This will help increase visibility and get more attention from potential students who want help with any subject area. Choose the locations for providing home tutoring services There are a number of locations where you can provide home tutoring services. The location is not really important, as long as it is convenient for you and the student. The first thing to consider is the type of students that will be taking your classes. If you have older students who struggle with math, then you probably want to devise a different plan than if you are teaching younger children. If your program is online, then consider whether or not it makes sense to make the classes available only in certain geographic areas. This may mean that some students will have to travel far from their homes in order to take advantage of your tutoring services. Stay in touch with the parents The most important thing a home tutor must do is stay in touch with the parents. Parents should be able to contact the tutor if they need help or have any questions. The tutor should also provide information about their students progress. The parent can then send messages to the tutor if they notice that their child is not doing well or has problems in school. If a child is having difficulty at school, it is important for himher to talk about it with hisher parents and hisher teacher. This helps both of them find ways to improve their performance at school. Takeaways  Everyone has something unique to offer, search for it and provide the best service in your home tutoring business. Ask yourself. What makes you different from other tutors? You are a superstar and the students will love you. This is because they will feel comfortable with you. Your positive attitude and enthusiasm toward helping others will be noticed by the students. It is important to make sure that your personality is reflected in your teaching style. Its easy to get frustrated when a student doesnt understand something, but if youre able to stay calm and keep working with them, theyll eventually get it.

The education industry is constantly evolving with the development of edtech solutions. Conventional classrooms are now outfitted with smart solutions to deliver exceptional learning experiences and improve efficiency. Online tutoring is one of the most popular edtech concepts, growing exponentially over the last decade. According to a recent study, the global online tutoring market size was worth 29.6 billion in 2021, and is estimated to grow to 49.9 billion by 2028, a 9.1 compound annual growth rate in seven years. Teaching communities are swiftly adapting to the online tutoring landscape, enticed by the ease of teaching and improved learner experiences. Powered by cloudbased tools, the growth of online tutoring has opened up ample teaching opportunities for teachers beyond physical classroom boundaries. Teachers no longer have to work for educational institutions necessarily they can now build a progressive business on their own terms. In countries like the United States, tutors mostly charge on an hourly basis. An online tutor earns an average of 25hourstudent. In countries like India, tutors charge on a monthly or yearly basis and earn up to 32.5Kmonth. Likewise, your revenue range will depend on the subject you teach, your certifications, and market demand. If youre teaching a niche concept with valid certifications, you can earn much more. Revenue also depends on the mode of tutoring. Broadly, there are two modes of tutoring general elearning centers and onetoone private tutoring. Some tutors offer instruction in both modes learning centers for large audiences and onetoone private tutoring for limited students who prefer exclusive focus and nurturing. Tutors usually charge higher rates for onetoone private tutoring. The main advantage of online tutoring is that anyone can begin with minimal investment and basic computer skills. It simply requires your knowledge, time, dedication, and keen focus to grow. To get started, just like any other business, the first step in online tutoring is market research and demand analysis. You can start your research by narrowing down your areas of interest and corresponding level of expertise. Once you figure that out, you can research the demand for that particular subject in the market. A demand analysis is vital to having a clear picture of your business positioning, pricing, and other attributes. Funneling your online tutoring business to a welldefined set of learners will help you grow progressively and have a clear career path. There is always a demand for language, math, and science tutors. Parents look for private tutors for their kids to help them cope with foundational concepts that are missed in their regular schooling structures. The tutoring demand stretches from elementary to college levels. Besides subjectspecific tutors, theres also a considerable demand for preparatory tutors for the SAT and other competitive exams. If you are a trained teacher who can handle special children, you can focus on teaching autistic and special needs students. Currently, theres a sizable demand for specialized tutors to teach special needs students. From a broader perspective, to run an online tutoring business you will require three types of tools A tool to host your classes. A tool to enroll and automate your learners communications. A tool to manage payments and other business activities. To get started, an educationalfocused, contenthosting platform is an absolute necessity. Online tutors host classes using two main methods You create a course curriculum and bundle a sequence of content that suits your teaching goals. To host prerecorded educational content, youll need a content hosting platform that distributes content to learners in a sequential manner. So, always select a provider that supports native content hosting with sequential learning tools to streamline how your lessons are consumed by the students. You might be tempted to host videos on YouTube and create subsequent playlists, but it is always better to choose an online course platform. You can host a live session for either a group of people or a single student, and teach in real time. Live tutoring is preferred by larger audiences because it gives students a sense of personal teaching and a classroomlike experience. So, when choosing a platform to host live tutoring classes, look for important elements such as streaming reliability, student engagementcommunications tools, and scalability. The live tutoring platform should provide a highquality streaming service with options to create session URLs as well as screen sharing and session recording. Teaching tools like whiteboards will be a great addition for teachers when explaining complex concepts. Learner engagement is critical for live classrooms to build studentteacher rapport and avoid boredom during long sessions. Features like emojis, a raise hand function, live chats, and quizzes can make the whole learning experience engaging and more efficient. When starting an online tutoring business, its easy to enroll and manage learners when theyre in small numbers. Consider having 30 learnersnow think about the amount of effort required to manage their enrollments, session notifications, payment reminders, and more. Sounds tough, right? You need an automated system to collect student information and enroll them in appropriate classes without much manual intervention. Aligned with the automated enrollment tool, youll need a communication module to send automated messages to learners during enrollment and other milestones. You can create workflows and set automated emails when your learners reach their milestones, send class notifications, automate payment reminders, and much more. Finance is a tough task to manage but an important aspect to master when running a business. Especially true for online tutoring businesses that mostly operate on a subscriptionbased model, its difficult to send payment notices manually and receive payments. So, its important to choose an integrated, flexible payment tool that supports different payment modes and gateways, automates payment reminders, and updates information accurately to the learner database. Online course platforms will be a great fit for online tutors to host classes and manage operations efficiently. These platforms offer integration and the right set of tools to run a scalable online teaching business. There are numerous online course platform providers in the market offering diverse solutions pivoted around online teaching. You can research and compare online course platforms that suit your requirements and help reach your business goals. When choosing an online course platform, consider these important points It provides an integrated platform with the perfect blend of tools to host classes and business operations. It offers an option to host live classes within the platform. Its costeffective and doesnt charge a sales commission. It has a customizable email communication system. It supports a robust payment system with gateway integrations. Once you set up your online tutoring business, the next step is to increase your digital presence and create brand awareness. You can leverage social media to create an online profile and post regular content to become an influencer in your subject area or niche. Consistently delivering valuable content will help you attract followers and convert them to paid learners down the line. To go further, you can allocate a budget and explore paid marketing services such as Google Ads, Facebook ads, and influencer marketing. But before spending heavily on marketing campaigns, you should calculate the ROI and add it in as a factor when setting your course pricing. You should also master the art of garnering learner reviews and testimonials. Reviews play an important role in others decisionmaking process and can help speed up your sales cycle. Always stay connected with your learner community and try to build up a library of learner stories and testimonials. Online tutoring is a fastgrowing, lucrative business where you can get started immediately without much hassle. All you need is a strategic mindset, and work consistently to hit your business goals.
