No Sharing. 100 Confidentiality India has been the largest milkproducing country in the world for the last 25 years. The Indian dairy market is the largest in the world, accounting for 23 of global milk production. The dairy industry consists of 2 connected businesses, i.e. operating a dairy farm and processing the milk pasteurisation, skimming, homogenising, fortifying and packaging. Both these businesses have also been significant contributors to the countrys economy, and many processing units are emerging as thriving businesses in all corners of the country. Dairy farming is also a crucial component of the industry. The most significant share of the market in dairy farming is held by the cooperative sector, which is owned, operated, and controlled by dairy farmers. The industry function with the collective cooperation of numerous farmers and cooperative organisations with gaushalas and smallcapacity animal farms. Farm owners sell their products to dairy plants which then process and manufacture different milk products. On the other hand, the dairy industry requires a planned collection, transportation, processing, quality testing and distribution of the products in a very short period. Many dairy units also maintain their own dairy farms and gaushalas and use their products in processing. Along with these come many exercises, such as managing sheds, cleaning the farm, feeding the cattle, or even washing and milking animals that can complicate the work. However, the profits associated with packaged and processed milk and its products are much higher than the sale of loose milk. So farmers choose to sell the product to the business that can not only manage the operation at a large scale but also impart value addition to the product, such as greater shelf life, taste, flavour and a broader market reach. The products made in the dairy industry include The demand for milk and its products is high in all seasons. Also, starting a dairy farm business in India costs approximately 10 to 20 lakhs.
